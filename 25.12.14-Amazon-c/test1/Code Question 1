Code Question 1
There is a project consisting of n unique tasks. Each task is assigned to one individual team member. The tasks are ordered by priority from 1 to n and for simplicity, the ID of each team member is the same as the task's priority, for example, the team member working on the tasks with priority i will be referred to as i.
Note that:

All members always arrive in a fixed order each day.
A team member always leaves before the next member in order arrives.
A task assigned to a team member can only be started when all preceding tasks have been completed (either in the last days or on the same day but before this task).

When a task is started by any team member it will be finished immediately and the next task can be started from that time.
Find the minimum number of days required to complete the project, and if the project can't be completed the function must report an error.
The project can't be completed if any of the team members working on some tasks are missing, or if a task is assigned to more than 1 team member.
Function Signature
FuncStatus_t
schedule_tasks(int32_t arrive_order[],
const uint32_t num_tasks,
int32_t &days_needed)
Input Parameters
arrive_order: an array of integers representing the order in which each team member arrives each day.
num_tasks: the size of the array arrive_order.
Output Parameters
days_needed: the minimum number of days needed to complete all tasks.
Return
Returns a status code indicating if there is an issue or not.
Provided Data Types
typedef enum
{
STATUS_GOOD, /* The project can be completed /
STATUS_ISSUE, / The project can't be completed */
} FuncStatus_t;
Explanation:
For the first day:

The first team member working on the second task will arrive, but can't start on their task since the first task is not completed.
The second team member working on the first task will arrive and finish their task (since no prior tasks are required).
The third team member working on the third task will arrive, but can't start on their task since only one of the two prior tasks are completed.

For the second day

The first team member working on the second task will arrive and finish their task (since all prior tasks are completed).
The second team member already finished their task.
The third team member working on the third task will arrive and finish their task (since all prior tasks are completed).

Example 2:
Input:
arrive_order: [2, 1, 2]
num_tasks: 3
Output: 0
Return: STATUS_ISSUE
Explanation:
There are two team members assigned with the second task and no one is assigned with the third task so the project can't be completed.

代码题 1

有一个项目包含 n 个不同的任务。每个任务分配给一个团队成员。任务按优先级从 1 到 n 排序。为简化起见，每个团队成员的 ID 与其任务的优先级相同，例如，负责优先级为 i 的任务的团队成员 ID 为 i。

注意：

所有成员每天都按固定顺序到达。

一位团队成员总是在下一位成员到达之前离开。

分配给团队成员的任务只有在所有前面的任务都完成后才能开始（要么在最近几天完成，要么在同一天但在该任务之前完成）。

当任何团队成员开始一个任务时，该任务会立即完成，并且可以从该时间点开始下一个任务。

求完成该项目所需的最少天数。如果项目无法完成，函数必须报告错误。

如果负责某些任务的团队成员缺席，或者某个任务分配给了多个团队成员，则项目无法完成。

函数签名

FuncStatus_t

schedule_tasks(int32_t arrive_order[],

const uint32_t num_tasks,

int32_t &days_needed)

输入参数
arrive_order：一个整数数组，表示每个团队成员每天到达的顺序。

num_tasks：arrive_order 数组的大小。

输出参数

days_needed：完成所有任务所需的最少天数。

返回值

返回一个状态码，指示是否存在问题。

提供的数据类型
typedef enum

{
STATUS_GOOD, /* 项目可以完成 /

STATUS_ISSUE, / 项目无法完成 */

} FuncStatus_t;

说明：

第一天：

负责第二个任务的第一位团队成员会到达，但由于第一个任务尚未完成，因此无法开始执行第二个任务。

负责第一项任务的第二名团队成员将到达并完成任务（因为无需完成任何先前的任务）。

负责第三项任务的第三名团队成员将到达，但由于之前两项任务中只有一项已完成，因此无法开始工作。

第二天：

负责第二项任务的第一名团队成员将到达并完成任务（因为所有先前的任务均已完成）。

第二名团队成员已完成任务。

负责第三项任务的第三名团队成员将到达并完成任务（因为所有先前的任务均已完成）。

示例 2：

输入：

arrive_order: [2, 1, 2]

num_tasks: 3

输出：0

返回值：STATUS_ISSUE

说明：

有两名团队成员被分配到第二项任务，但无人被分配到第三项任务，因此项目无法完成。
